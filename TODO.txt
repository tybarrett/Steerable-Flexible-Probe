TODO for Steerable Flexible Probe
- Get cost from brain map
- Implement cost function
  - with weights
+ Tune geometry to avoid divide-by-zero errors
- Finish implementing RG-RRT
  + attach new nodes to the closest node in each tree
  + execute with multiple trees
    - might want to re-consult the paper and see exactly how they are doing things
  - introduce parameters as described in the paper
    - max iterations
    + number of multiple trees
+ Determine boundary of brain map
  + write a method to see if a coordinate is inside the brain or not
  + and do not allow movement if it is outside the brain

TODO for Original Research
- Change start point to be at the tumor
- Change goal condition to be any place outside the brain
  - with a relatively orthogonal exit angle
- Run multiple simulations to compare cost values

TODO Stretch Goals
